******************************

The RabbitMQ Plugin has been installed.  The plugin requires properties be
defined in grails-app/conf/Config.groovy.  Specifically, connection factory
settings must be defined.  Example:

rabbitmq {
    connectionfactory {
        username = 'guest'
        password = 'guest'
        hostname = 'localhost'
        consumers = 5
    }
}

See the plugin documentation for more information.
